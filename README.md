# Umbra-Quest
2D Swing Game with a customizable and traversable map. The player can interact with NPCs by clicking on them to reveal dialogue, and can kill monsters by pressing "X" to shoot a fireball.

Side Note: Will need to change the .mp3 file to a .wav file in order to run the game with music.
